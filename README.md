#### Container Image: ghcr.io/gexcon/aws-kubectl:latest

## Container Build Repo

This is a dead simple container that just contains the latest (at build time):

- AWS CLI v2
- kubectl

to facilitate doing work with kubectl and aws. There are many similar repos on the internet, but most of them seem out
of date (basically just used for tutorials), so here we just made our own so that we can make sure that we keep it up to
date.
